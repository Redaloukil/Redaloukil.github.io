## The Day I Lost My Badge — And What It Taught me in my professional life

Every office day around 11:45 am, my colleague asks me if I want to join him for a quick lunch run to the supermarket. If I say yes, I usually grab my badge so I can get back through the security doors afterward.

That day, though, I looked at my desk and... no badge.

“Okay, maybe it’s under my laptop,” I thought.

Nope.

I lifted my laptop, moved my screen, checked behind my monitor. Nothing. Opened my headphone case. Still nothing.

And that’s when I started spiraling.

I stood up, panic mode activated. I looked under the desk, under my colleague’s chair, on the floor, next to my chair, on *his* desk, *anywhere*. My brain was telling me: "this doesn’t make sense — you always leave it on your desk."

But somehow, the more I didn’t find it where I expected it, the less I trusted that memory. I started doubting myself and searching in places with *very* low odds — just for the sake of *doing something*.

Then someone asked: “Have you checked your headphone case?”. I had. At least I thought I had. “Yeah, nothing there..” I replied, still spinning.

So I widened the search area.

The kitchen.  
The coffee machine.  
Above the coffee machine (why would it even be there??)  
Even outside the building.

“Wait... am I really checking the pavement outside for my badge?”

It hit me. I was letting the panic lead. My search area was expanding rapidly, while the probability of finding anything useful was shrinking.

I went back inside. Sat at my desk. Took a breath.

Let’s go over this again, I told myself, but this time, slowly.

Laptop? Nothing.  
Behind it? No.  
Under the headphone case?

*Wait.*

The bottom of the case felt… weird. I flipped it.

There it was. My badge. Tucked in a pocket I hadn’t properly checked.

## If I had to break it down:

1. I discovered a problem: missing my badge.
2. I searched the place where I *knew* it should be — my desk.
3. I didn’t find it, and panic started.
4. I rushed, skipped over details, assumed I had checked spots more thoroughly than I had.
5. I fell into the **Exhaustive Search Fallacy** — the idea that “since I didn’t find it in the obvious place, it could literally be *anywhere*.”
6. My brain started spinning irrational stories: “Maybe it’s on the kitchen counter?” “What if I dropped it outside?”
7. I finally calmed down, retraced my steps, trusted my memory, and boom — found it where it had been all along.


## What I Learned

As a software engineer, this whole thing felt *weirdly familiar*.

It reminded me of every bug hunt, every “weird issue in production,” where the fix turns out to be one missing line, one misnamed variable, one check you *thought* you did.

A few takeaways:

- **Trust your memory** — especially under pressure. It’s probably more accurate than your panic.
- **Don’t let stress expand your search domain too early**. Stay grounded.
- **You probably *didn’t* check that thing as thoroughly as you think.**
- **Trust people's opinion** especially the ones not in the tunnel
- **We’re not wired to think clearly under time pressure unless we train for it.**
- And most importantly: sometimes the answer is right in front of you — hiding in plain sight.
